### cgroups

Most confusing topic encountered so far. Struggled to find good resources and examples. Initial exploration of `/sys/fs/cgroup` was overwhelming.

I first tried `cd sys` but was getting an error. The tutorial showed a cgroup being made by making a directory at `/sys/fs/cgroup`.

**"Magic Filesystem" Concept*: Realized `/sys/fs/cgroup` isn't real files on disk. It's a virtual filesystem that provides human-friendly interface to complex kernel syscalls

**Hierarchical Structure**: Understanding that `cgroups` form a tree where children inherit parent limits and can never exceed them
Practical Usage: mkdir creates new cgroups, echo sets limits (e.g., echo 100M > memory.max)

## Analogy

Office Building: Dwight = parent cgroup controlling building resources (AC, toilet paper), departments = child cgroups inheriting his stingy limits.
